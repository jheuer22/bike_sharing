Tableau analysis of Bike Sharing data. 

## Overview of the statistical analysis:
For this analysis, we are using data on the CitiBike usage from New York City from the month of August 2019 as a point of comparison for a new bike sharing business in Des Moines, Iowa.  We believe that a similar Bike sharing business will succeed in Des Moines based on the analysis summarized below. We used Python Pandas to change the datatype of the "tripduration" column from our source data from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then used Tableau Public to create a set of visualizations to show our findings. These visualizations display: 
 - the peak hours and locations of rental usage. 
 - the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders. 
 - the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week. 
 - the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Linked below is the Tableau Story created based on the analysis.
